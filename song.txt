[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

[Intro: Diddy]
I'm back where I belong (Uh, yeah)
I never felt so strong, ayy (Yeah, I'm back, baby)
I feel like there's nothing that I can't try (Uh, nothin')
And if you with me put your hands high (Yeah, put your hands high)
High, ayy (If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you)
And if you with me put your hands high (And you, the dreams are for you rocking with the best)
High, ayy (And you, and you)
I mean I'm strong
